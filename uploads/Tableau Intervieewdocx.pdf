A. Tableau Basics, Data Sources & Architecture
1. What is Tableau and what are its main uses?
“Tableau is a powerful business intelligence tool for data visualization and analytics. I use it
to connect to different data sources, analyze data visually, and build interactive dashboards
for business users.”
2. Describe Tableau’s architecture.
“Tableau has a client-server architecture: Tableau Desktop for building, Tableau Server and
Tableau Online for sharing, and Tableau Public for publishing open dashboards. Tableau Prep
is for data prep. Each component plays a role in the analytics lifecycle.”
3. What’s the difference between Tableau Desktop, Server, and Public?
“Tableau Desktop is for developing visualizations. Tableau Server is for sharing and
collaboration securely within an organization. Tableau Public is free but for public content
only—anyone can access what you upload.”
4. What are the main file types in Tableau?
“TWX/TWB (workbook), TDS (data source), TDE/HYPER (extract), TDSX (packaged data
source), and TWBX (packaged workbook).”
5. What are dimensions and measures?
“Dimensions are qualitative fields (like customer name, region), while measures are numeric
fields (like sales, profit) used for aggregation.”
6. What is a data source in Tableau?
“It’s any data connection—file or server—that Tableau reads to power its analyses.”
7. What are live vs. extract connections?
“Live means Tableau queries the data source in real time. Extract is a static snapshot (TDE or
Hyper), enabling faster analytics and offline access.”
8. What is a Tableau extract (.hyper)? When would you use it?
“It’s a compressed, high-performance file that speeds up analytics and supports offline
access. I use extracts for large or slow data sources.”
9. What is the Data Interpreter?
“A feature to help clean and format messy Excel or CSV data before analysis.”
10. How does Tableau handle different data types?
“Automatically detects types—string, number, date, geographic, boolean—but I can change
them in the data pane if needed.”
11. How do you connect Tableau to a database?
“From the Data tab, I select the database type, enter credentials, and connect. Tableau
supports almost all major relational and cloud databases.”
12. What are joins and blends in Tableau?
“Joins are row-level combinations within a single data connection; blends combine results
across two different data sources at an aggregate level.”
13. What is data blending and when is it needed?
“Blending is needed when data comes from different sources (e.g., SQL and Excel) and can’t
be joined natively—like combining sales from Oracle and targets from a spreadsheet.”
14. What are the limitations of data blending?
“It’s less performant, works at aggregate level, and left-joins only. Calculated fields across
sources are limited.”
15. What is a primary vs. secondary data source?
“Primary drives the main view, secondary is blended in. Blue check in data pane marks the
primary.”
16. What is the difference between joining and blending data?
“Joins happen in the database, row-level, with a single data connection. Blending is in
Tableau, post-aggregate, for combining different sources.”
17. What are hierarchies in Tableau?
“Hierarchies let me group related dimensions (like Country > State > City) so users can drill
down in dashboards.”
18. What is a relationship in Tableau (2020.2+)?
“It’s a flexible, logical link between tables that preserves their individual detail until
necessary—unlike physical joins, which merge up front.”
19. How does Tableau handle metadata?
“All field types, aliases, calculations, and relationships are stored as metadata in the
workbook or data source file.”
20. What is a calculated field?
“It’s a new field I define using formulas—enables custom metrics, logic, and more flexible
analytics.”
21. Where can calculated fields be created?
“In the data pane (for the entire workbook), in the view, or on the shelf itself for quick
calculations.”
22. What’s a context filter and why use it?
“A context filter narrows the data set before other filters—improves performance and
enables dependent filters.”
23. What are extract filters?
“They limit what data is brought into an extract, reducing extract size and improving
performance.”
24. What is a wildcard match in filters?
“A text filter that supports pattern-matching, like “%Inc%” to match all companies with “Inc”
in the name.”
25. What is data densification?
“Filling in missing values in data visualizations, so trends and lines aren’t broken even when
data is sparse.”
26. What are the differences between continuous and discrete fields?
“Continuous (green pills) are ranges—used for axes, allow trends. Discrete (blue) are
categories—used for labels, headers.”
27. What’s a Tableau workbook vs. worksheet?
“A workbook is the whole Tableau file; a worksheet is a single chart or visualization within it.”
28. What is a dashboard in Tableau?
“A dashboard is a collection of worksheets and objects, providing a single, interactive
analytical view.”
29. What is a story in Tableau?
“A story is a sequence of dashboards and worksheets, letting me walk users through a
narrative with data.”
30. What is a parameter? How is it used?
“A parameter is a dynamic value (number, date, or string) users can change to drive filters,
calculations, or reference lines.”
31. What is a data pane?
“It’s the sidebar listing all data fields, dimensions, and measures available for building
visualizations.”
32. How does Tableau handle null values?
“Nulls are shown as blanks, ‘Unknown’, or filled in with default logic (like ZN or IFNULL) if
needed.”
33. What is data granularity?
“The lowest level of detail in the data—deciding granularity is key to meaningful analysis.”
34. What are the types of filters in Tableau?
“Dimension filters, measure filters, relative date filters, context filters, extract filters, and
data source filters.”
35. What are quick filters?

to date.”
41. What are data roles in Tableau?
“Field designations like geographic roles (Country, State), or custom roles for grouping data.”
42. What is the difference between Save and Export?
“Save saves a workbook; Export lets me extract images, data, or cross-tabs for use
elsewhere.”
43. What is a published data source?
“A reusable, centrally managed data source on Tableau Server—multiple users can connect
to it for consistent analysis.”
44. How can you secure data in Tableau?
“With user filters, row-level security, published extracts with permissions, and by restricting
access on Server.”

“A tool for cleaning, shaping, and combining data before analysis—used when raw data isn’t
dashboard-ready.”
48. How does Tableau support big data sources?
“Through optimized extracts, live connections, query pushdown, and connectors for Hadoop,
Spark, etc.”
49. What are limitations when connecting to Excel?
“Excel isn’t as scalable or real-time as databases; large files can be slow and formula columns
may not always translate well.”
50. What are best practices for structuring Tableau projects?
“Organize data sources, use consistent naming, document calculations, use folders, and plan
for sharing/publishing.”
